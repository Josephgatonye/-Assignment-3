# **Gene_expression report**

## Question 1 - downloading the file, reading into R, making the gene accession numbers the row names, and showing a table of values for the first 6 genes
- Here the 'download.file()' command is used to fetch the dataset and 'read.table()' command  is used to read the tsv file into R.
- The data frame is then saved as oject "x" for easy computation using the '<-' command.
- The 'row.names=1' commmand is used to make the gene accession numbers the row names.
- It is also crucial to set 'header=TRUE' and 'stringAsfactors= FALSE' so that the data is formatted properly. - The 'head ()'command is used to show the first six lines of the data frame and the 'str ()' command ensures that the data structure is recognized as numeric. 
```{r,chunk1,echo=TRUE}
#Downloading the file and saving it as "gene_expression.tsv"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files/gene_expression.tsv",destfile = "gene_expression.tsv") 

#saving the file as an object x
x <- read.table("gene_expression.tsv") 

#cheking the data structure
head(x) 
str(x) 

#Reading into R making sure the 1st columns is set as the rownames, headers are recognized an only first 6 genes are shown
x <- read.table("gene_expression.tsv",header=TRUE,row.names= 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Showing showing a table of values for the first 6 genes
head(x)
str(x)
```
## Question 2 - Creating a new column which is the mean of other columns, and showing a table of values for the first six genes 
- We are creating a new column which is the mean of the previous columns using the "rowMeans(x)" command, labelling the new column as "ColumnMeans" and adding it permanently into the data frame "x" using the "$" command and the "<-" command and showing the table of values for the first six genes using the 'head ()' command 
```{r,chunk2,echo=TRUE}
# Making a new column ("ColumnMeans") which is the mean of the other columns
x$ColumnMeans<- rowMeans(x)
# Showing a table of values for the first six genes
head(x)
```
## Question 3 - Listing the 10 genes with the highest mean expression
- We already have a column with means of genes saved as 'ColumnMeans'. This column is ordered using 'order(-)' to show decreasing order of means of genes and saved as object 'x_ordered'.
- The 'list ()' function is used to show the data as a list and square brackets '[1:10,]' command used to specify a range of the first ten genes in the 'x_ordered' data frame.
```{r,chunk3,echo=TRUE}
# Listing the 10 genes with the highest mean expression
x_ordered <- x[order(-x$ColumnMeans),]
list(x_ordered [1:10,])
```
## Question 4 - Determining the number of genes with a mean <10
- Here we will subset the data frame'x'(which contains all the values), using the 'subset()'command and extract column 'ColumnMeans' which contains means of the genes.
- The '(x, ColumnMeans <10)' command gives data in the column 'ColumnMeans' which is less than 10, which is saved as 'no_genes'.
- The 'nrow()' command gives the number of rows in the data frame 'no_genes'

```{r,chunk4,echo=TRUE}
# Subseting the number of genes with a mean less than 10
no_genes <- subset(x, ColumnMeans <10)
nrow(no_genes) # provides the number of genes as 43124
```
## Question 5 - Making a histogram plot of the mean values in png format and pasting it into the report
- The 'hist ()'command is used to plot a histogram 
```{r,chunk5,echo=TRUE}
#saving histogram as png file
png("gene_expression.png") #creating a PNG file on the system
hist(x$ColumnMeans,main = "Histogram of mean values",xlab ="column means")
dev.off()
```

![](gene_expression.png "gene_expression Plot") #importing the file

#GROWTH DATA

# Question 6 
# Importing the csv file into an R object
```{r,chunk6,echo=TRUE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files/growth_data.csv",destfile = "growth_data.csv")
# Reading csv file into R
g<- read.csv("growth_data.csv")
head(g)
str(x)
# Finding the column names of 'g'
colnames(g)
```

# Question 7
```{r,chunk7,echo=TRUE}
ne <- subset(g,Site== "northeast") #subsetting site upto northeast and saving as ne
head(ne)#checking structure
str(ne)
mean(ne$Circumf_2004_cm)# getting the mean of circumfrence at the start
mean(ne$Circumf_2019_cm)# getting the mean of circumfrence at the end
sd(ne$Circumf_2004_cm) #getting standard deviation of  circumfrence at the start
sd(ne$Circumf_2019_cm)#getting standard deviation of  circumfrence at the end

sw <- subset(g,Site== "southwest")#subsetting site upto southwest and saving as sw
head(sw)
str(sw)
mean(sw$Circumf_2004_cm)# getting the mean of circumfrence at the start
mean(sw$Circumf_2019_cm)# getting the mean of circumfrence at the end
sd(sw$Circumf_2004_cm) #getting standard deviation of  circumfrence at the start
sd(sw$Circumf_2019_cm)#getting standard deviation of  circumfrence at the end
```

# Question 8
```{r,chunk8,echo=TRUE}
boxplot(ne$Circumf_2004_cm,ne$Circumf_2019_cm)# box plot of tree circumference at the start and end of the study at north west 
boxplot(sw$Circumf_2004_cm,sw$Circumf_2019_cm) # box plot of tree circumference at the start and end of the study at south east
```

#Question 9
```{r,chunk9,echo=TRUE}
growthdif1<- (ne$Circumf_2019_cm - ne$Circumf_2009_cm) #getting the growth difference over 10 years(2009$2019) @ North east
mean(growthdif1)# getting the mean of growth difference

growthdif2<- (sw$Circumf_2019_cm - sw$Circumf_2009_cm) #getting the growth difference over 10 years(2009$2019) @ south west
mean(growthdif2)# getting the mean of growth difference
```

# Question 10
# Ho: mean ne$Circumf_2019_cm = mean ne$Circumf_2009_cm 
# Ha:Two-sided test
# non-equal variances from boxplot
```{r,chunk10,echo=TRUE}
t.test(growthdif1,growthdif2)# There is a huge difference because of p-value < 1
wilcox.test(growthdif1,growthdif2)
```
t.test is used to test difference between the means of two groups)# For purpose of hypothesis testing in statistics
calculating t.test requires difference between the mean values from each data  # (p-value <1)                                                                                                                                       
wilcoxon test is  the rank sum test that compares two paired groups to determine if two or more sets of pairs differ from one another in terms of statistically'
